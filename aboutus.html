            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>We are three university students who share a passion for animals and the well-being of pets. Our journey began with the idea of creating a platform that connects pet owners with reliable and loving pet sitters and walkers. As students with busy schedules, we realized the need for trustworthy services that could provide pets with the care they deserve while their owners are away.</p>
            <p>We wanted to build something that would help both pet owners and pet care providers find each other easily and reliably. After working hard on this idea, we launched Pet Patrol, a platform where pet lovers can offer their services as sitters and walkers, ensuring pets get the best care possible.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is simple: to make sure every pet gets the love, attention, and care they deserve. We aim to connect pet owners with trusted and compassionate pet sitters and walkers in a way thatâ€™s easy, efficient, and reliable. By providing a space where pet lovers can come together, we hope to foster a community of pet owners and caregivers who share the same values of trust, safety, and respect for animals.</p>
